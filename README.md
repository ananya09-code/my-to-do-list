# Advanced To-Do App

A simple yet advanced **Python-based To-Do App** with task management, status tracking, and JSON persistence. This project demonstrates Python fundamentals, file handling, input validation, and professional coding practices.

---

## **Features**

- Add a new task with a status (`done`, `not done`, `in progress`)  
- Remove a task  
- Update a task (description or status)  
- Mark a task as completed  
- Show only completed tasks  
- Show only pending tasks  
- Tasks are saved to a JSON file (`task0.json`) for persistence  
- Input validation and duplicate task handling
